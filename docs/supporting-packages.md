# Installing a debug-enabled Arduino package

Arduino packages are the key to making debugging available in the Arduino
IDE 2. There are two types of such packages. Either debugging has been
integrated by the package maintainer or it is a fork of an existing
package. Either way, if you want to install such a package, you first
have to add a new *boards manager* URL in the
`Preferences` dialog.

{!details-boards-manager-url.md!}

Once this has been done, you can search in the <code>Boards Manager</code> for the package, and install it or upgrade to the most
recent version. In case of a debug-enabled fork, the version number is
usually postfixed by `-preX` and the name of the package will have
`(Debug enabled)` attached to the official name.

## Hardware packages with integrated debugging solutions

### [TinyCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/TinyCore)

This is a fork of ATTinyCore version 2.0.0. It is the preferred way of supporting classic ATtinys.  It does not support the micronucleus bootloaders, however. You can install it after including the following URL:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/TinyCore/package_MCUdude_TinyCore_index.json
```

### [MicroCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore)

This is a package for the ATtiny13(A). You can make it installable by adding the following URL to the Boards Manager URLs:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/MicroCore/package_MCUdude_MicroCore_index.json
```

### [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore)

This is the package for the small ATmegas with a debugWIRE interface, aka, ATmegaX8.  You can make it installable by adding the following *boards manager URL*:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/MiniCore/package_MCUdude_MiniCore_index.json
```

### [XMiniCore](https://github.com/felias-fogg/XMiniCore)

This is a debug-enabled Arduino package for the Microchip development boards [ATmega328P Xplained Mini](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/atmega328p-xmini), [ATmega168BP Xplained Mini](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/atmega168pb-xmini), and [ATmega328PB Xplained Mini](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/atmega328pb-xmini). It is meant to be a replacement for the *Atmel AVR Xplained-minis* board package of the official Arduino distribution. The new package is a stripped-down and adapted version of MiniCore. The boards, together with PyAvrOCD, work very smoothly (see [quickstart guide for ATmega328P Xplained Mini](quick_arduino.md#quickstart-atmega328p-xplained-mini)). It is just plug-and-play:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/XMiniCore/package_felias-fogg_XMiniCore_index.json
```

### [MightyCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore)

An Arduino package for ATmega8535, ATmega16, ATmega32, ATmega164, ATmega324, ATmega644, and ATmega1284, whereby ATmega8353 does not have a debugging interface. You can make it installable by adding the following *boards manager URL*:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/MightyCore/package_MCUdude_MightyCore_index.json
```

### [MegaCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCore)

A package for most 64 and 100-pin AVRs. For example, the Arduino Mega (2560) is supported by this package. All of the [listed MCUs](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCore#supported-microcontrollers) are debuggable, but the ATmega128 has the problem that only hardware breakpoints are allowed. You can make the package installable by adding to the *boards manager URL*:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/MegaCore/package_MCUdude_MegaCore_index.json
```

### [MajorCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MajorCore)

This package covers just ATmega8515 and ATmega162, of which only the latter possesses a debugging interface. The additional *boards manager URL* is:

```
https://mcudude.github.io/MajorCore/package_MCUdude_MajorCore_index.json
```

## Debug-enabled forks of official Arduino packages

<a id=arduino-avr-boards></a>
### [Arduino AVR Boards](https://github.com/felias-fogg/ArduinoCore-avr) (Debug enabled)

This is the debug enabled fork of the standard Arduino package, which supports all Arduino AVR boards. The only changes are

- additional programmers,
- changes to platform.txt to enable debugging,
- changes to boards.txt to enable the JTAG pins on boards with the JTAG interface, and
- an upgrade to version 8.0 of avrdude.

You can make this fork available by including:
```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/ArduinoCore-avr/package_felias-fogg_ArduinoCore-avr_index.json
```

<a id=arduino-megaavr-boards></a>

### [Arduino megaAVR Boards](https://github.com/felias-fogg/ArduinoCore-megaavr) (Debug enabled)

This is the debug enabled fork of the megaAVR Arduino package, which supports the Nano Every as well as the Uno Wifi Rev2 boards. Note that these are also supported (offering more configuration options) by [MegaCoreX](#megacorex). The only changes to the upstream repo are:

- additional programmers,
- changes to platform.txt to enable debugging,
- change to boards.txt to set the default programmer for the Uno Wifi Rev2, and
- an upgrade to version 8.0 of avrdude.

You can make this fork available by including:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/ArduinoCore-megaavr/package_felias-fogg_ArduinoCore-megaavr_index.json
```


## Debug-enabled forks of 3rd party packages

<a id=megacorex></a>
### [MegaCoreX](https://github.com/felias-fogg/MegaCoreX)  (Debug enabled)

This is a fork of the package for the megaAVR-0 chip family, such as the ATmega4809, which is used on the Nano Every Board and the Uno WiFi Rev 2. You can make the debug-enabled fork of the package available using the following URL:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/MegaCoreX/package_MCUdude_MegaCoreX_index.json
```

Expect to find the debug extension soon in the upstream repo.

<a id=megatinycore></a>
### [megaTinyCore](https://github.com/felias-fogg/megaTinyCore) (Debug enabled)

This is a fork of the package for modern ATiny Chips (series 0, 1, and
2). Make the debug-enabled fork available using following URL:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/megaTinyCore/package_SpenceKonde_megaTinyCore_index.json
```

<a id=dxcore></a>
### [DxCore](https://github.com/felias-fogg/DxCore) (Debug enabled)

This is a fork of DxCore, the package for the most recently marketed AVR chips. Nake the debug-enabled fork available by using:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/megaTinyCore/package_SpenceKonde_DxCore_index.json
```

<a id=attinycore></a>
### [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/felias-fogg/ATTinyCore) (Debug enabled)

This is a debug-enabled fork of ATTinyCore version 1.5.2, which covers all classic ATtinys with a debugWire interface. While it might still be of interest to people who use the micronucleus boot loaders, nowadays [TinyCore (see above)](#tinycore) is the preferred package for classic ATtinys. You can make this fork available by including the following URL:

```
https://felias-fogg.github.io/ATTinyCore/package_drazzy.com_ATTinyCore_index.json
