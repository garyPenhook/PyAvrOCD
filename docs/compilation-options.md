# Compiling the program

A necessary prerequisite for debugging a program is that you compile it.

## Compiling an Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE 2

Compiling the Arduino sketch is done by clicking on the Verify button in the top right.

Before doing that, it is advisable to select the `Optimize for Debugging` option.

This will select the debugging-friendly optimization option `-Og`, which supports single-stepping and stopping in every line. However, selecting this option will enlarge the size of the binary code significantly. If the resulting binary code does not fit into flash memory, one can debug less comfortably with a disabled `Optimize for Debugging` option.

When the binary code gets too large because of the `Optimize for Debugging` option, you may consider conditionally disabling parts of your code. When the `Optimize for Debugging` option is active, the compile-time constant `DEBUG` is defined. So you can deactivate part of your code when the option is active as follows:

```C++
#ifndef DEBUG
...
#endif
```



For some of the debug-enabled Arduino packages, it is possible to disable *link-time optimization* (LTO). This can be helpful because it will preserve some debugging information ([see below](compilation-options.md#lto)).

!!! info "Disable 'Optimize for Debugging' setting after debugging has finished."
    Once `Optimize for Debugging` has been activated, it will also be enabled for other projects. You have to explicitly disable this option in order to get smaller binary files again.



## Compiling in other environments

In most IDEs and, of course, on the command line, you usually have full control over all the compiler and linker settings. There are a few compiler options that are critical for debugging.

### Critical optimization options

- The <a id='level'>*compiler optimization level*</a> for MCUs is usually `-Os`, meaning that the needed space in flash memory should be minimized. For debugging, one should choose `-Og` instead, which optimizes for space but tries to keep the control flow as similar as possible to the source text, i.e., no inlining or code re-ordering. Of course, the produced binary will be bigger than when using `-Os`.
- <a id="lto">*Link time optimization*</a>, enabled by `-flto` for compilation and linking, will prune away dead code during link time. In addition, it may also do code inlining across compilation units. Further, the currently employed GCC  version 7.3.0 prunes debugging information, such as information about global variables and class structures. For this reason, it is advisable to disable link-time optimization when debugging.  However, this is not possible for the Arduino packages that support modern AVR MCUs.
- <a id="relax">*Link time jump relaxation*</a> is enabled by the compiler and linker option `-mrelax`. This will try to replace `JMP` and `CALL` instructions with `RJMP` and `RCALL` at link time. While it sounds like a reasonable and easy optimization, its implementation is unfortunately buggy when it comes to the generation of debugging information. The line number information is completely garbled, at least in GCC 7.3.0. So this option should *never be used when debugging*.
- <a id='die'>*Including debugging information*</a> is enabled by the compiler option `-g`. This may enlarge the size of the object file in ELF format, but does not lead to larger binaries. So, this option can always be used at no cost. Using `-g3` or `-ggdb3`  instead of `-g` will additionally record macro definitions, which might be helpful for the debugging process.
